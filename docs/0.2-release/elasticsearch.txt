This release requires a dependency on elasticsearch instance running.

TODO: Maybe hibernate search will only run from database if elasticsearch is missing??? Need to check this

There are two ways of integrating elasticsearch with the application.

1. via hibernate
2. via spring-data-elasticsearch

The hibernate route was chosen as the approach. Maybe as the project matures, we might swap out hibernate with
spring-data-elasticsearch and drop the relational database altogether. We need to think about this though!

We have chosen the latest version of hibernate. This should hit Final in february 17.
<hibernate-search.version>5.7.0.CR1</hibernate-search.version>

One issue with this is that you must use a elasticsearch version < 5.

We chose 2.4.4 as that seems to have good hibernate-search support.

  https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-2-4-4

Hibernate will not support elasticsearch 5.x until hibernate 5.8 or hibernate 6. See:

  http://in.relation.to/2016/11/29/hibernate-search-5-6-0-Beta4-and-5-7-0-Beta1/


ce running, elasticsearch was tested using

  curl http://localhost:9200

JSON response OK, everything OK at this point


Step 2. Check application settings yml files for elasticsearch properties

After getting elasticsearch/hibernate running, the following exception was thrown

Caused by: org.hibernate.search.exception.SearchException: HSEARCH400024: Timed out while waiting for for index
'nikita.model.noark5.v4.fonds' to reach status 'green'; status was still 'yellow' after 10000ms.

This appears to be a problem because elasticsearch seems to be expecting to be working in a cluster and wants
to replicate the data model (??). After an index is created, the health of the cluster is "yellow" causing hibernate to
throw HSEARCH400024.

The following command fixes the problem:

curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_template/replicate_template' -d '
{
  "template" : "*",
  "settings" : {"number_of_replicas" : 0 }
}

This creates a template for all new indexes setting number_of_replicas=0
